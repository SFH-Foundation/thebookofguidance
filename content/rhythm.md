title: Balancing Hope
---

Do the work  
trusted to your hands:  
it's always right  
in front of you.  
  
[[Light]]'s rhythm perpetuates  
itself through empty space.  
Let this gift spark hope  
and see how hope hangs  
  
in the passing balance,  
is just  
another thread of what is  
timeless.  
  
Tune with that,  
hold it together  
with the background radiation  
big bang of self.   
  
Unify both.   
  
Then ask for silence  
and stop dead.   
There is only ever  
One.
