title: Graceful Meeting
---

I watched a friend fall weeping  
to his knees before you,  
though you did nothing  
to make him feel small.  
  
It was just  
the grandeur of the [[human]]  
condition up close  
which caused his longing  
to overflow.  
  
I looked away,  
breathing with the bamboo  
growing behind you,  
swaying gently in the breeze,  
not wanting to intrude further  
on this infinite intimacy.  
  
Though, in [[truth]],  
it is everything,  
and I know what you said  
when you whispered in his ear,  
even if the exact words  
escaped me.  
  
I trust you'll find me patient,   
for this first moment we met  
exists forever.
