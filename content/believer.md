title: The Prayer

God  
grant me the honesty  
to live this lie,  
this failure which finds [[form]]  
in the written word,  
and the humility   
never to mistake my limits  
for what is  
perceived through them,  
this shining point:  
  
neither begetting nor begot,  
before the birth  
of a white amaryllis tinged pink  
in a show of pure devotion,  
its dance of constant death  
until separation stops  
in objectless love,  
emptied in Your fullness.
