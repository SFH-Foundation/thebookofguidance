title: Do Fidem
---

A green spider greeted me  
as I got back home today,  
telling me of that time  
I sat in the Great Hall  
and gave my faith  
in a language long forgotten  
as her friend leapt from  
my mortar cap and caused  
some commotion with the girl  
sitting next me.  
  
Time was sown together  
by [[being]] began  
and the seamstress  
will still be at it  
after you're done here,  
once you've cried your heart clean  
as those who set the ranks  
come to carry you  
into precreation.  
  
Perfect!  
Peace be with you all:  
the promise is fulfilled.
