title: Red-Winged Worship
---

A bird sings alone  
its sunset song,  
the only sound  
ever made:  
  
worship.  
  
Praise for One  
from this single starling  
stirred by sea breeze  
and the seven names  
to know this   
simple truth:  
  
[[You]] are loved,  
infinitely  
  
and no bird is ever alone,  
held as it is  
by a whole universe.
