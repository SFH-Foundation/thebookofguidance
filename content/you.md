title: You
---

My life has left me  
for love of You.  
Just one letter remains.  
  
No state. No station.  
No way [[beyond]] here.  
  
Nothing higher.  
Nothing lower.  
Nothing other  
than this,  
for its own sake.  
  
Feel it and find there is  
no feeling.  
  
I am that  
empty field,  
soulful.
