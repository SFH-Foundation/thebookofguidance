title: Pictures of You
---

There's that photo I adore  
of you looking [[beyond]] the beach  
with the old shepherd   
who played sister to   
this small boy.  
  
You throw the doors open  
every morning to watch our horizon  
sink into a golden sea, so  
it's faded now, the top half  
almost completely white  
and I wonder at this metaphor   
for all our fate:  
simply to fade into light.  
  
This loss we call living  
is so alive with love,  
it's a lie to even say it.
