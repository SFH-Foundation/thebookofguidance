Our being  
a part  
of this particular wave  
which carried us deep  
into the sacred forest  
where yellow woods speak  
in silence  
and God's primary friends,  
blue and green and  
bright shock of red flight,  
gathered to sing  
their saw song  
that sliced through  
yet one  
more self-image,  
left me still in this  
[[endless]], awe-struck,  
amazed.  
  
A labyrinth of love  
which led, later,  
to the land's lodestone,  
Earth's lyrics laid out  
in time-lapse  
as we stood on a bridge  
over a river called Home  
and witnessed  
two mating eagles  
make new life,  
calling out from on high  
a hint about heaven,  
right here,  
for which I have no words.
