title: The Straight Path
---

The path by that oak tree  
will take you straight  
up the mountain  
to a secret  
crystal garden which shows  
itself  
to unwanting souls  
who have scaled the cliff  
face to face  
and been found  
by the [[balance]]  
in their own breast,  
bought in a bargain  
which is all about loss,  
left stranded in the bare  
rocks as soft rain returns  
once more to this deep ravine,  
reminded that the mercy  
of a desert does not care  
who you think you are.  
  
It drenches everything:  
there is no escape.
