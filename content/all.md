title: Telling All
---

It's all been cut,  
the entire series of stories  
I set out to collect.  
  
No apologies either,  
just a straight telling  
as it is:  
this greatest show  
cannot be found  
by searching.  
  
For the story  
is recollecting you  
and will only return  
to an empty heart  
which k[[now]]s it cannot hold  
the feather-light  
humility of rain  
and yet will die trying,  
entranced by one pink bloom  
drenched in this eternal spring.
