We went all the way  
from Gilgamesh to the event  
horizon, here in   
the family tomb with two dogs,  
bearers of a single letter,   
and a cat from beyond the wall,  
where it was both and neither:  
a living death which can't be known.   
  
It is so near,  
this breathing in and out,  
every time a hallelujah,   
the end of a cycle beginning   
to close the [[circle]]  
which will make everything  
a centre  
and call upon each to recite  
one clear sign.  
  
Here it is,  
reluctant teacher,   
a declaration of my [[love]]  
without condition:  
the peace of God is now  
always.   
  
Not for you   
nor for me  
nor for anyone:  
just fidelity for One  
who made me to  
feel the passion  
of what passes,   
lit by permanent life.
