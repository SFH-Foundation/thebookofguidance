The sunbird sings,  
dancing his emerald ecstasy  
in this ephemeral day,  
daring you to realise  
there is no time  
in which [[now]] can last.  
  
Turn around  
and walk back out  
the prison gate that reads  
"I am".  
Give up your whirlpool self  
and dissolve into this  
single stream.  
  
Now is not a moment.  
The shining dance  
of this translucent bird  
is a whole world of delight  
without duration.  
  
Nothing lasts.  
It is only ever presence.
