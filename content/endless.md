title: Infinite Reel
---

No-one wrote this dedication.  
No-one will ever read it.  
  
Truth took me  
and I said: You are  
my teacher.  
  
One real laugh  
returned, resigned.  
  
Here is the lesson  
of how to live a lie  
which stands  
for what is not Me.  
  
What does not pass  
and will not die when you do,  
[[balance]]r of the book  
with these words which hide  
the clear way  
to One sacred heart,  
the hearth of My infinity.
