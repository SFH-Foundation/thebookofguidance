title: The Perfume-Seller's Heart
---

You set fire to a rose  
which had been drying for years  
with all your rosaries  
in an old purse of remembrance  
and spoke of how the [[essence]]  
of fire is everywhere,  
just waiting  
for space and time to ignite.  
  
We sat quietly in  
ancient scent,  
a hint of oudh singing  
softly beneath it all,  
the dust of this  
[[eternal]] petal  
still totally unmoved,   
passing from heart to  
heart.
