title: First Time, Last Moment
---

This moment is a rout  
and will leave you standing  
at the goalposts  
declaring total <a href="https://quran.com/3/18-85" target="_blank">surrender</a>,    
[[obvious]] defeat in the face  
of perpetual [[victory]],  
the root of One  
to whom every route  
returns, right on time.  
  
Fear is the heart of hope  
until you find there is nothing  
to miss, no-one to miss it:  
just a tattered prayer flag  
washed white by endless wind,  
not a single word left showing.
