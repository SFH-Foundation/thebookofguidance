title: Flowing Memory
---

The birds sing me back  
together, rising into a night  
whose darkness proves  
time had a dawn  
and will draw to a close,  
but not before a soft rain  
[[right]]s the land's empty heart,  
this desert which so longs to flow  
like the sea it remembers being  
that it releases a scent  
sweet enough to flood memory  
and drown me, again  
in unity.
