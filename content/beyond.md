title: Beyond Love
---  
  
The moon has moved since  
I first arrived here:  
now the light breaks in unfettered  
by my balcony bars;  
pure and still as I breathe out  
and put me down,  
not knowing  
who will inhale next.  
  
This silver edge of surrender  
searches out the sincere  
who have accepted separation's  
show, sure the shore  
is one more sign that here,  
even the silent depths curl  
into _sajda_ and sing  
_subhanallah_.  
  
It's all this  
[[moment]] culminating  
in a life:  
time's work  
to teach the syntax of one  
soul sought by her  
Beloved.
