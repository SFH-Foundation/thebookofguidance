title: The Simurgh
---

All these years gathering ash  
and watching it blow away  
until finally,  
one still day  
head down on a [[peace]]ful hill  
where they buried you,  
some ancient bird  
began to breathe.  
  
All the walks in those woods  
were just grooming,  
the start of letting go,  
weaving one's way  
from world to truth.  
  
All became fire,  
then. No friends left  
until mercy called from  
the empty space between embers:  
there is no escape  
in truth, by the truth  
of your own upbringing.  
  
All the ash was not different,  
then, from the gold  
you once thought  
you'd gathered,  
though held now in one heart's  
boundary, built just  
to bring truth back,  
bare and unadorned.  
  
None of it was real,  
until now.  
There is only the Real  
and we are cast out  
to catch perpetual life,  
then commanded to return  
having revealed,  
by virtue of our service,  
the sacred Light that lives in  
all.
