Walk the lighthouse keeper's path  
[[right]] to the point  
beyond where they tell you  
you can't go.  
  
There's a small cave there  
you can shelter in,   
singing softly  
while you watch two seas meet  
and let your heart be moved  
by your own testimony  
made before time:  
to keep the flame lit  
so that we can be safe  
sailing the starry deep,  
your spinning devotion  
just a blinking light in the distance  
that hints at Truth:  
  
The promised land is here,  
be careful how you approach.
