title: Empty Form

Here's another fiction  
about how I fought the temptation  
to look through a stone at sunset  
so as to tell the future,  
because I felt in a diamond flash  
free of the need to know anything  
but now.  
  
We traveled home that night  
in an old bakkie and I sat  
still in the back, before being  
blown away by your [[silence]].  
  
Old friend, what a gift  
that cramped seat was,  
singing as it did of wide  
open space  
and this [[faith]] which is no faith:  
which is known and seen and  
never used.  
  
I have no idea  
what really happened, of course,  
though I'll lay my life down  
in a heartbeat to hear  
your silent love again.
