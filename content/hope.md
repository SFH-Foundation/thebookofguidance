title: Hope's Fire
---

There's a blaze  
I heard about long ago,  
somewhere out there  
in the mountains, I think.  
  
I set out to search for it,  
even summited a peak or two  
where I could sense the message  
being passed above cloud-tops:  
  
"Come!  
The battle is joined  
and the dark forces are poised  
to overwhelm us."  
  
Desperate to join  
the soul's riders  
I roamed, dangerously  
close to the edge.  
  
Eventually, tired of looking,  
I let myself down  
into an unfamiliar valley  
and there: first sight of the flame.  
  
I fanned it,  
as if I could breathe  
life back into fire itself,  
begin to feel it again.  
  
My arrogance snuffed  
that precious light  
and I knew real suffering,  
total and severe.  
  
Until the whole range  
burst beyond hope.  
First, the overwhelming heat,  
holy and uncaring.  
  
Then, completely engulfed  
in fire's fury and finally  
at [[peace]],  
for I set it all myself:  
  
before it was heard  
or told or thought,  
this heart was alight,  
inspired by life's love.
