The verdict is in, old friend:  
there will be no recovery.  
  
I am laid [[bare]]  
on this bright path.   
The white petals of wind  
whispered it to me,  
wrapped up in this wishing  
well of ink which never ends,   
though I've written,   
by command,   
ten thousand thousand lines.   
  
What a life it is,   
this life.   
  
This single, endless life  
which let me go that icy night  
by an old river, returned  
to uncover this [[soul]]-knowing  
flow back to source.
