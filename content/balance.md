title: Burning Blue
---

The [balance](https://quran.com/57/25) of flames  
backed by endless ocean  
and a single sentence  
from the Voice:  
  
"The story is one  
of how much I loved."  
  
Beyond tense and time  
or any kind of sense,  
just [[simple]] [[victory]].  
  
Here is the sworn will:  
you will remember.  
It has been written for all,  
always.
