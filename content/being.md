title: Take Two
---

Who am I? A single drop of light,  
held in this loving eye.  
What is the world? The [[endless]] stream  
of water falling with me.  
  
The way you look  
determines which arc you see:  
a white wave  
in wayward movement down,  
or this wide trajectory,  
smashed on red rock  
and set free to fly  
through green air,  
seeming to chart its own course  
before it returns,  
right on time,  
to the black body 
it has always been.
