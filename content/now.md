title: The Infinite Moment
---

Sometimes it's all at once,  
sometimes it takes weeks  
to gather one word, like  
now.  
  
This expansive single point,  
pulsing still,  
for those who bet everything  
on red or black,  
only to find a green zero  
grinning at the spinning  
trick of time.  
  
We are constantly dying,  
dearly beloved,  
so put your head down  
and see each [[moment]]  
annihilate itself  
in your resurrected chest:  
  
one more petal  
falling  
from an infinite flower.
