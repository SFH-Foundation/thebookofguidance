title: The Gift
---

Belonging wholly  
to a patch of grass  
is the greatest [[gift]]  
today has given me.  
  
The sun, dancing trees  
and whispers of a world  
without me in the way,  
wandering.  
  
No will  
for it to be other  
than what it is.  
  
There is nothing special  
about this grass;  
that is the [[miracle]].
