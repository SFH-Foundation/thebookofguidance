title: Zoom Zen

Here is a gift  
of two Egyptian geese ghosting  
across the full moon as it dips  
below the dawn horizon, which  
is the meaning  
of "I take refuge in the Buddha."  
  
This [[being]]  
who laughs lightly at the children    
running through yesterday's rain,  
who smiles when they stop  
to pick up the smallest dog,   
drenched beyond endurance,  
then begin to dash again  
through the open heavens.   
  
It's just heartfelt  
silence in the middle of life,  
a feeling with this whole world  
until I am drowned  
in boundless thanks,  
bewildered by this little boy  
who bows and picks me up  
and bears me with him  
back home.
