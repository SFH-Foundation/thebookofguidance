title: Fully Formless
---

Act like an empty field,  
a moment made up  
by imaginal points,  
carriers of this presence,  
all part  
of a fluid praise  
from nothing to nothing,  
its empty form full  
of compassion for being  
awake: simply  
here, [[beyond]]  
opposite others,  
the gates open,  
yellow flowers arranged  
by the real  
author over old footpaths  
where fools still come  
to stop.
