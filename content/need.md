title: Never-ending Need
---

Will you give your life  
for nothing?  
  
There is a primal honesty  
in that first flash of "No!"  
until you walk this whole  
universe and wonder  
at how none of it is  
separate.  
  
All this bursting [[song]]  
and [[empty]] space  
you swam through,  
just to see  
that there is   
nothing to give,  
to witness  
that none of it is yours,   
yet willingly keep waking up  
because that is what it means,  
this grace and glory,   
the trust in which we're held  
  
and the only thing that's "me":  
never-ending love of God.
