title: Whale Song
---

A southern right was born here yesterday,  
breaching for her first time  
just behind the breaking waves.  
  
This wayward of deep song,  
brought forth by a dream  
handed down from mother to daughter  
as they divine the depths  
and draw breath from between  
two blues: a departure point  
to which she will return,  
reminded by means behind memory  
of this wide, wild bay  
called home.  
  
[[Remember]] your own day,  
[[dancing]] with your beloved,  
letting her brave the blue current  
without telling her what to do,  
just trusting her heart to know,  
as it always has,   
in ways which will not be understood.  
  
We have walked the edge  
of fractal fountains, falling  
into rainbows and robberies  
and the everyday rhythms of life:  
all of it one  
drawn-out ritual of rebirth.  
  
A fish eagle and a comorant  
came to pay their respects  
to this newborn carrier of the old chorus  
and, while it doesn't quite match  
the old story about a condor,  
we are a people after prophecy:  
imprinted with the promise of return,  
forced to choose our path.
