title: Light Surfing
---

Behind first break, the blue  
see-through has been so clear  
you can catch the movement  
of transparent fish and each little  
grain of sand as it is sucked out  
and then rushes back to shore  
with every passing wave,  
well-wishpering for all   
the broken shells:  
our sea's secret shakers  
shoring up this song.  
  
What's more, what's so far  
beyond my measure,   
is the [[light]].  
  
It dances on the ocean floor  
in endless ripples,  
a rainbow ringing forever's rhythm,  
reaching through the hollow waters  
to rhyme with swirling sand.  
  
Even the waves forgotten  
in this illumination,  
for today I woke up  
shocked to see the same  
stream of single truth   
traced in seven ways  
across my skin,  
itself moving just like  
the sands below.  
  
What bliss to simply be  
here.
