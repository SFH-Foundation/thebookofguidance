title: The Question
---

What will bring you here  
apart from a journey to the heart  
of hell?  
  
Will you stand then,  
next to that accursed tree  
and still speak the name?  
  
Can you bear  
bring Satan to your prayer mat  
to make peace?  
  
No messiah now,  
not in this place where  
you must face your own folly.  
  
Yet, here is the Generosity:  
it is your fate to find  
light is both  
the essence of fire  
and its result.   
  
That all the people you were  
on the way in here  
still hold a shred of the fool's [[hope]]  
that hell only tends toward eternity  
and that their name will be called  
  
still, on the stroke of midnight.
