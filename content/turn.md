title: Tur(n)ing Strip

It's just a  
long tape traced with  
endless 1's and 0's  
as far as the eye can see,   
until I seek myself  
and join the ends,   
though this sight turns the tape  
so that every [[time]] you think  
you've got the message:  
  
_"Go to zero, be at one._   
_In oneness, all is nothing."_   
  
You sense you haven't,  
though you are at the same place,   
this single surface you know  
is doubly illuminated,   
because you're stuck again  
on the other side.   
  
All these different states  
your reader has roamed through   
until the emptiness formed  
by this self's own site  
is struck by a humble heart,  
leaving nothing  
but the scent of honesty.   
  
This universal message  
only moves because it is held  
back from my mind.  
  
O [[majesty]]! It is magnificent.
