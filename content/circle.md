title: Open Drop
---

Full circle back here  
to the one  
drop of truth in False Bay,  
thanking two  
friends for all  
they taught this fool  
of [[life]] in death  
without denying  
separation's seams.  
  
Their graves are overgrown,  
full and ongoing  
in green abundance,  
every flower flowing  
as I fold  
and admit my loss  
in the light  
of those already given  
to living love.  
  
Finally,  
eyes wide open,  
I turn  
up a grass stalk,  
struggling with the seed's weight  
and breathe in again,  
bewildered  
to see a three-petaled pattern  
I've known only in dreams  
and had let go  
as empty symbol,  
now stunned by what springs  
from where they buried me:  
  
this open field,  
bursting at the seams.
