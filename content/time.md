title: Two Timing
---

Herbal tea at the end   
of space and time:  
there is nothing  
sweeter than this  
seamlessness.  
  
Say: we are two  
touched by One,  
told to be,  
eternally bound,  
but - right now - timeless.  
  
Tell me again  
how it opens,  
this chapter of [[praise]]  
for the [[source]] of power:  
the might of this mercy  
which moves us pilgrims  
on a path from It to It, by It,  
where beginnings end  
and all there is to do is  
stop,  
  
sip and listen with  
every cell to this song,  
freshly minted   
in a Garden grown  
around any frame of mind.
