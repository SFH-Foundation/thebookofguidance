title: The Trial

"Tell them:  
I might not be here tomorrow,  
but you met a [[believer]].  
There is only One."  
  
And us two,   
stood still here,   
delighted.   
  
You said it so softly:  
no claim, no blame  
about the tests before us,  
no desire to disclose any more.  
   
I walked inside  
and sat alone  
and sipped the candlelight  
for an hour,  
drunk on love,  
drowned in majesty  
until another, equally obsessed,  
sat down facing [[me]]:  
  
"I am the only One  
who will ever stand trial."
