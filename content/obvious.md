title: Only Song
---

That old music, the beat  
beneath time,   
taps out this peace,   
now arriving at  
the part where you tell me  
the whole is  
suspended in [[Grace]].  
  
I don't [[need]] to ask  
what song it is:  
it belongs to the soul  
and is always being sung  
here, between  
star jasmine and dog turd,  
one more duality  
indicating fragrant Truth.
