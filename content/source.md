title: Fine Scripture Constant
---

There is only one  
light passing through two,  
interfering with itself   
to paint a pattern  
on the screen of [[you]].  
  
Gradually the gaps grow  
smaller, the path narrows,  
the ignited beam is fine-  
tuned to just a single point  
swimming in emptiness,  
still somehow seeking  
every possible way  
to wave at being.  
  
Until the slits slam shut  
and all is utter darkness,  
reality no longer   
screened by your illusion so   
that there is,  
simultaneously,  
total illumination as this  
beam tunnels back, bearing  
a timeless script which sings  
sacred Oneness.
