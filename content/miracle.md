title: Breathing Starlight
---

The light is overflowing  
everywhere,  
between the trash and tragedy  
and endless glory of every bow  
before the retreating water  
of this bloated world  
which blazes one truth  
now,  
  
now, now, now!  
The blue insists  
in every turning instant  
and tiny peace of plastic:  
a heart has truly seen  
the star descend,  
has dragged itself to this  
edge  
  
where, by grace, it gave up,  
finally lost, drowned  
in [[all]] this mercy.
