title: Between Being
---

One white butterfly floats by  
beneath the sun's [[rainbow]] halo  
as I come back to _salaat_,  
singing of the seam in being  
both creature and eternal reality  
rapt in God.  
  
I let her go  
and follow the [[rhythm]] of this prayer,  
until she finds her mate  
resting in the spearmint  
and makes a pair which passes  
in perfect dance  
perpetually.  
  
I am struck  
that mine is no supplication,  
but a simple statement of fact:  
this world is blessed,  
before and after, forever.  
The seven circles around today's light  
are just one  
more sign of super natural life.
