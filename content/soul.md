title: Soul Sight
---

A mountain looks on  
and laughs,  
cresting in its own  
tectonic time  
before it crashes back  
into the ocean.  
  
This holy sea  
of light between you  
and God.  
  
Tell them, lover,  
of how I set sail  
with soaring [[hope]]  
and was stripped bare  
by sincerity.  
  
How I sank in that storm  
like a blue stone,   
was swallowed by the depths,  
way down past any thought  
of destination.  
  
Only to be shown  
there is no distance,  
there was no time,  
that what matters  
about mountains is not  
their minerals but their merriment.  
  
Majesty!  
Move me only  
to this remembrance,  
reverence for a [[love]]  
already within.
