title: Never Mine
---

Though no thought can get  
there, there  
is a tiny crack   
in the circle of self.  
  
The shadows stretch  
far beyond  
what you can see,  
but there is another kind of sight.  
  
The day of arrival,  
signified by a burning sun  
set at just the right angle  
to all these breaking waves,  
  
your whole galaxy [[form]]ed  
by infinite returns  
for this single moment  
of grace  
  
like a pulse  
which passes understanding:  
all your masks removed,  
bare and unburdened  
  
before time begins  
and after it ends and in  
every instant, simply  
silent and still.  
  
Still here, forever.   
  
So we let the poet stand  
and pretend to sing his truth,  
though if you reflect  
on his ignorance,  
you'll realise  
it was never his  
and that the message  
has not changed.  
  
Give up  
even this acceptance  
of the light, for what is  
is greater.
