# Unifying The Blue Book

Why is there something instead of nothing, and what should we make of it? Perhaps the purpose of human life is _unification_. We are a people between, and it seems that durable contentment is to be found by walking the middle way with honesty, humility, modesty, courage, kindness, and gratitude.  

This is part of my [ongoing](https://thebluebook.co.za) [attempt](https://living.thebluebook.co.za) to [explore](https://dyeing.thebluebook.co.za) the meaning of fulfillment. What is this peace which passes understanding?
