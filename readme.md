# The Book Of Guidance

We want guidance that shows us the truth within our own heart. We need commitment and consistency along the path so the self yields to its root and origin - the inner soul.

If you measure the good and the bad in terms of longevity or durability, then you are nearer to the reference of truth and guidance within you. In other words, what is ultimately good for me is to have access to a zone that constantly thrills me and gives me personal contentment and happiness. That is really what is good, without a bad. 

We want guidance which is not subject to change, which is not subject to the relative ups and downs. I am subjected constantly, minute-to-minute in each of my senses, to things which change and yet I want to steer a course which gives me that inner constancy so that, in my heart, I am content and happy. Therefore, I need that reference to a zone which is forever reliable, which is what I call the soul. And my access to the soul is through my heart, because the soul dwells in my heart. If the heart is pure, then I have access to it. If it is not, then I am already coloured by my own lenses.

Wisdom is a spectrum - at one end it has to do with rationality and good guidance, and at the other end it is pure, infinite light.

The natural outcome of knowledge and guidance is the experience of sacred presence and its perfection.
